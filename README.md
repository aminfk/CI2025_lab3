# CI2025_lab3
CI2025 – Lab 3: Shortest Path Algorithms

This mini-project contains two notebooks:

1. problem_creator.ipynb

Includes all the utilities for generating graphs:

random graph generator

line, star, grid graphs

negative-cycle example

save/load functions

This notebook is only used to produce graphs for the experiments.

2. experiments.ipynb

Runs shortest-path experiments using:

Dijkstra (when no negative edges)

Bellman–Ford (when negative edges exist)

The notebook includes:

a grid of experiments with different sizes, densities, noise levels, and seeds

runtime measurements

full results table

summary table (averaged runtimes)

comparison table between algorithms

one example of path reconstruction

negative-cycle detection

How to run

Run all cells in problem_creator.ipynb

Run all cells in experiments.ipynb
Everything needed is already inside the two notebooks.
